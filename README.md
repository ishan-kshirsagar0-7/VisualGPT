# VisualGPT - ChatGPT with AI Image Generation

VisualGPT is a web application built with Flutter that combines the power of ChatGPT with the ability to generate AI images, using OpenAI's GPT-3 API and DALL.E 2 API.

## Description

VisualGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to have a conversation with a language model trained on a vast corpus of text data. But, unlike other chatbots, VisualGPT also has the ability to generate images based on text prompts.

With VisualGPT, users can enter a text prompt and receive an AI-generated image related to the prompt. For example, if a user enters the prompt "A beautiful sunset" or "A beautiful sunrise", VisualGPT can generate an image of the sunset or sunrise respectively.
